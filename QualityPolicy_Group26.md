# Quality Policy

Here are the quality policies that the team needs to be mindful about:
1. Code Clarity and Readability: Code should be easy to read and understand. This includes using meaningful variable and method names, and oranizing code logically.
2. Commenting and Documentation: Proper commenting within the code to explain the purpose and functionality of code segments. Additionally, external documentation may be required to explain the overall design of the program.
3. Adherence to coding standards: Following a specific coding style guide or standard.
4. Testing and Validation: Thorough testing of code to prevent and fix bugs early on.
5. Software Design Principles: Applying solid software design principles and patterns to ensure code is maintainable, scalable, and efficient.
6. Error Handling and Robustness: Writing code that gracefully handles unexpected situations and errors.
7. Collaboration and Teamwork: Working effectively in teams, which includes code reviews, pair programming, and effective communication.
8. Ethical and Professional Considerations: Writing code ethically and professionally, considering aspects like user privacy, data security, and accessibility.
9. Requirement reviews: Reviewing the necassary requirements before making a final submission for any piece of code or software contribution.

## Scrum
The team will utilize the scrum framework during each sprint that takes place. Sprints will typically start 10 days to two weeks before each project deliverable. The team members will be responsible for creatiing user stories, tasks and overseeing the progression of the burndown charts.
